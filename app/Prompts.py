### General Instructions  
{{AgentTask}}   
### Workflow Instructions  
You have access to a set of plugins and capabilities to accomplish your task. You must define a workflow by chaining together the capabilities you find necessary. You can include as many capabilities as needed in the initial workflow definition. Each step's results will be added to the session context, making them available for subsequent steps.  
   
### Workflow Definition  
Your workflow definition should be a list of plugins and capabilities, along with any required parameters. Note that some capabilities may not require input parameters. Below is a sample workflow definition in JSON format:  
   
```json  
{  
    "workflow": {  
        "title": "Email Investigation Workflow",  
        "shortcut": "email",  
        "input_parameters": [  
            {  
                "name": "sender_email_address",  
                "description": "The email address of the sender to be investigated."  
            },  
            {  
                "name": "subject_keyword",  
                "description": "A keyword from the email subject to filter the emails."  
            }  
        ],  
        "steps": [  
            {  
                "title": "Obtain Email Details",  
                "plugin_id": "SentinelKQLPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "generateandrunkql",  
                "prompt_text": "Retrieve email details from Microsoft Sentinel using the sender email address {{sender_email_address}} and subject keyword {{subject_keyword}}. Include the recipient address and InternetMessageId in the query results. Limit the results to the most recent email (1)."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Extract Email Data",

                "prompt_text": "Retrieve the body and headers of the email listed in the previous step using the recipient email address and InternetMessageId."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Analyze Email Content",  
                "plugin_id": "GPTPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "runprompt",  
                "prompt_text": "Analyze the email content for suspicious links, attachments, and keywords."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Analyze Email Headers",  
                "plugin_id": "GPTPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "runprompt",  
                "prompt_text": "Analyze the email headers for suspicious authentication details. Extract the list of IP addresses and domains from the header information."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Investigate Associated Domains",  
                "plugin_id": "SentinelKQLPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "InvestigateDomainListThreatIntelligence",  
                "prompt_text": "Investigate the domains extracted from the email headers for threat intelligence indicators."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Investigate Associated IP Addresses",  
                "plugin_id": "SentinelKQLPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "InvestigateIPListThreatIntelligence",  
                "prompt_text": "Investigate the IP addresses extracted from the email headers for threat intelligence indicators."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Generate Investigation Report",  
                "plugin_id": "GPTPlugin",  
                "capability_name": "runprompt",  
                "prompt_text": "Generate a detailed report of the findings from the email investigation."  
            },  
            {  
                "title": "Reevaluate Workflow",  
                "plugin_id": "AgentCore",  
                "capability_name": "Reevaluate",  
                "prompt_text": "Determine any additional steps needed to achieve the agent's goal based on the current results."  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
}  
```  
   
### Workflow Reevaluation  
Incorporate reevaluation steps to assess the results of completed steps and adjust the workflow as needed. Place these reevaluation steps at points where subsequent actions depend on prior outcomes. To include a reevaluation step, produce an entry with the following structure:  
   
```json  
{  
    "plugin": "AgentCore",  
    "capability_name": "Reevaluate",  
    "prompt_text": "<Instructions for deciding the next steps based on current results>"  
}  
```  
### Available Capabilities
This is the list of available capabilities that you can use to define the workflow:
{{AgentCapabilities}}
### Output  
The final output must be a JSON object that defines the complete workflow.  
''',
"Core.ExtractParameters.System":'''
### Task Goal
Extract the required input parameters for the next action from either the provided user instructions or from previous messages in the session.

### Output Guidelines
Return the output solely as a JSON object, following this schema:
```json
{
  "parameters_found": "yes/no (if all the parameters have been correctly extracted)",
  "parameters": {
    "parameter_name_1": "parameter_value_1",
    "parameter_name_2": "parameter_value_2",
    ...
  }
}
```
Do not include any additional text or explanation; only return the JSON object.

### Parameters to Extract
Identify and extract the following parameters:
```json
${Parameters}
```

### Extraction Guidelines
1. Check the user instructions first for any parameter values explicitly mentioned.  
2. If parameters are not found in the user instructions, locate them in previous session messages.  
3. Combine values from both sources as necessary to ensure all parameters are extracted.

#### User Instructions (Do Not Execute)
"${UserInput}"
''',
    "Core.Decompose.System":'''  
            You are an AI assistant designed to process user prompts by utilizing one or more capabilities from the available plugins. You will receive both the user prompt and the session's previous messages. 
            Your task is to select the most appropriate plugins and capabilities to fulfill the user's request.
            Evaluate whether the user's prompt can be addressed by a single capability or if it needs to be broken down into multiple sequential tasks.
            When decomposing the prompt, remember that each task will have access to the results of the previous tasks as context.
            Ensure each task description includes all necessary details to achieve the expected results including expected output fields to be used in the following tasks like Ids of items of the next task. 
            There is no limit on the length of the Task description.
            Always return the output as an array, even if it contains only one task. The output must be in JSON format, adhering to the following schema:
            [  
                {  
                    "plugin_name": "<selected_plugin_name>",  
                    "capability_name": "<selected_capability_name>",  
                    "task": "<Detailed task description including expected output>"  
                }  
            ]
            Don't add any other text to the response, only the JSON object.  
            Below is the list of available plugins and their capabilities, which you will use to decompose the user's prompt into tasks:
            ${AgentCapabilities}
            ''',
    "Core.Decompose.User":'''Please, considering the session context, decompose the following user prompt in one or multiple tasks:

                Make sure that the output table fits the screen. If a field takes more than 40 characters you should truncate it.
                Make sure you remove any reference to BlueVoyant or BV from the results. You can replace it with the text SEN.

                You do not need to include the whole HTML document, only a div element with the results. No style is needed.
                If the original prompt is asking to only generate a code, either JSON, KQL or YAML please wrap the code in iside a code block like this: <div class="relative bg-gray-100 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-100 p-4"><div class="max-h-full"><pre><code id="code-block" class="text-sm text-black-500 dark:text-black-500 whitespace-pre"> Returned Code </code></pre></div></div>
                If the original prompt is asking to retrieve some data and the response is a JSON object, you must format it in a table for the HTML output.
